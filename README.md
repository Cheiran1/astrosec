# 🌞 AstroSec — Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings  
*A NASA Space Apps 2025 Hackathon Project*


## 🚀 Overview

**AstroSec** is a **digital illustrated storybook** created for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 under the theme  
> 🛰️ *“Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings.”*

Project Details: Stellar Stories: Astra's Space Weather Adventure

The project is a digital, interactive children's story that simplifies complex space weather phenomena, such as solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), for elementary school students (ages 7-10). Titled "Stellar Stories: Astra's Space Weather Adventure," it narrates the experience from the perspective of an astronaut, Commander Astra, aboard the International Space Station (ISS), showing the real-world impact of these events on orbit and Earth.


## 🌟 Challenge Summary

Space weather refers to the variations in the space environment between the **Sun and Earth** — including solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and solar winds.  
Though invisible to the naked eye, these phenomena can cause real-world effects such as:

- 🌍 **Auroras** dancing in the skies  
- 📡 **GPS disruptions** affecting navigation  
- 📻 **Radio blackouts**  
- ⚡ **Power grid instabilities**  
- 🚀 **Risks to astronauts and satellites**

In today’s technology-driven world, understanding space weather is more important than ever — and **storytelling** is a powerful way to teach young minds how cosmic forces shape our daily lives.


## 🎯 Objectives

Our mission is to:
- 🧠 **Educate** children about space weather and its effects in a fun, interactive way  
- 🎨 **Visualize** solar events and their journey from Sun to Earth  
- 🗣️ **Narrate** the story from an **astronaut's perspective**.



## 📖 What benefits does it have?
The project provides several key benefits:

Educational Impact: It takes an inaccessible, complex topic (solar physics and space weather) and makes it understandable and engaging for a young, non-technical audience.

Engagement & Narrative: It uses a relatable, fully developed character (Astronaut Astra) and a narrative structure to hold the attention of children, effectively bridging the gap between space science and human life.

Increased Awareness: It raises awareness of the varying impacts of space weather on modern technology, including effects on GPS communication, satellite operations, and power grids
