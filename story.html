                <p>But just like us, the Sun has different moods. Learning about the Sun’s moods is called learning about <strong>space weather</strong>.</p>

                <p>The Sun isn’t always calm. Deep inside, swirling currents and tangled magnetic fields build up energy. Sometimes this energy bursts out as bright flares or massive clouds of charged particles — we call this space weather.</p>
                <p>These storms travel through space and can shake Earth’s magnetic shield.</p>

                <p>A solar flare is a huge flash of light. The alarm told me it was time to go to a special part of the station with thicker walls to keep me safe.</p>

                <p>After the sneeze, the Sun also burped out a <strong>great cloud</strong>. This wasn’t a cloud of rain. It was a giant, wobbly bubble of magnetic stuff called a Coronal Mass Ejection, or CME.</p>
                <p>This great cloud floats through space much slower, taking a couple of days to reach Earth, but it's very powerful.</p>

                <p>When the Sun’s storm finally hit Earth, its invisible shield worked hard to protect us. But the storm still caused some trouble! Some cities lost power, radio signals went fuzzy, and GPS signals sometimes drifted.</p>
                <p>Satellites in space shook a little, and astronauts like me had to stay safe inside shielded modules.</p>
